I want to clarify that I am not affiliated with LockBit or engaged in any black hat activities. This archive was created because I observed that authorities were planning to shut it down within three days, and I wanted to preserve a goofy ahh memory. Every element was created from scratch, and the images are sourced from the website. Enjoy the archive.
