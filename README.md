#LockBitSeized Blog Archive:

Well, the LockBitSeized blog may currently be inaccessible. In light of this, I've taken the initiative to create an archive to preserve the valuable content, despite the time constraints that led to the less polished HTML and CSS design, so it may be kinda ugly.

Here's what you need to know about the archive:

No Local Hosting Required: The archive can be accessed directly without the need for local hosting.
No JavaScript Dependency: It's built solely with HTML and CSS, ensuring compatibility and simplicity.
No Online Dependencies: There are no external data requests or dependencies, enhancing security and reliability.
