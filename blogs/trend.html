                            Lockbit has regularly been seen right at the very top of the ransomware ecosystem when it came to number of data leaks per month, and impact on the internet overall. But beneath that seemingly successful outward persona, the groups have had notable issues and difficulties in recent times – reaching across all aspects of their criminal enterprise. They also have not had a major updated version of their core flagship ransomware suite in over a year – giving their competitors a chance to step up with more innovative solutions.<br>
                            In this publication by Trend Micro researchers, we discuss the history of the group, and show evidence that it has not all gone as smoothly as it may appear on the surface. Working in collaboration with the NCA, we will also publish for the first time a detailed technical analysis of what we believe was a next potential platform agnostic rewrite of the Lockbit code, which we track as Lockbit-NG-Dev. Over the publication we show that while successful, it is not without its internal issues, and that no criminal group is too big to fail.<br><br>
