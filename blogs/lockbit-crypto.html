                            Lockbit have carried out thousands of confirmed attacks over their 4 year lifespan, meaning their impact can be measured in the multi-billions of dollars globally. Based on NCA access to their systems, we provide some headline assessments of their profits, and are linking crypto transactions to the group and their affiliates.<br>
                            A key partner in the broader UK investigation, the South West Regional Organised Crime Unit, supported by Chainalysis, has led in the tracking and monitoring of thousands of cryptocurrency addresses linked to Lockbit. Lockbit exposed exchange accounts are also being targeted, with hundreds of thousands of USD worth of crypto assets across more than 85 accounts currently restricted by Binance. We continue to progress this work and more details will come to light as we progress the investigation.<br>
