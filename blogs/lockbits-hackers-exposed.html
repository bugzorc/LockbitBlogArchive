                            A large amount of data has been exfiltrated from Lockbit's platform before it was all corrupted. With this data, the NCA and partners will be coordinating further enquiries to identify the hackers who pay to be a lockbit affiliate. Some basic details published here for the first time. Our message to LB affiliates... <br>
